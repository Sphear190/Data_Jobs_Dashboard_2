# Data Job Dashboard2 Using Power BI

## Introduction

This dashboard was made to be used by people who are trying to get their first data job (**Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer**) and want to compare them as well as the more advanced versions of these jobs. This is a follow up project to an online class I took created by [Luke Barousse](https://github.com/lukebarousse) and [Kelly Adams](https://github.com/kellyjadams). In this dashboard I not only compare data jobs, but built the dashboard in a way to be both visually different as well as to answer a question.

## How do data jobs compare to one another?

On this page I demonstrated how the data jobs compare to one another based on three key characteristics.

-  **Skills:** Median number of traits required for the job.

-  **Availability** Number of jobs applications available each year (Job count).

-  **Salary:** Median yearly pay for a new higher.

When looking at **"Skills Vs. Availability"** and **"Availability Vs. Salary"** We can see a clear grouping of entry data jobs (Analyst, Scientist, Engineer) having *High Availability* but *Lower Pay* while Senior jobs have *Lower Availability* but *Higher Pay*. It is also noteworthy to point out that **Data Analysts** have a *Very High Availability* while requiring the *Least* amount of *Skills* making them ideal for people new to data jobs.

In **"Salary Vs. Skills"** we see a clear progression between entry data jobs and their senior counter parts. In all three cases we see both an increase in pay as well as an increase in skills required. We can even see an ideal pathing from *Data Analyst* to *Senior Data Scientist* or *Senior Data Engineer*. In **Data Job Details** we even see that while *Data Scientist* seems more ideal path, it has a vastly higher percent requirement for a degree (93%) while *Data Engineer* does not (only 53%).

## Data Job Details

Once the Job seeker has an idea of which data job they would like to pursue, the *Data Job Details* gives them more information on what's required and expected. By clicking on their ideal job, they can see a percentage of jobs that require a degree as well as allow work from home. Furthermore, the top 10 skills gives them an ideal as to what training they will need. In addition to requirements this page also shows expected wages as well as likely job schedules.

## Conclusion

This dashboard focuses on two focuses on 2 questions to better help newcomers in getting an ideal of what data job is rite for them. *Data Job Comparison* answers the question "How do data jobs compare to each other?" while *Data Job Details* answers the question "What is required and expected for these jobs?" By answering these two questions the viewer will have a better idea of what job they will want to pursue and what they need to work on to get that job.
